Anmol performed his role exceptionally.\\nRena Berman\\nAnmol worked on his first Ruby on Rails project for me at MathWorks; adding a new workflow onto an existing feature. He was able to ramp up very quickly on new technologies and a complex design. I was very impressed that Anmol was able to suggest improvements to the new design barely a week into the project. He is eager to learn, doesn't waste time, and is very easy to work with. I would highly recommend Anmol!Anmol worked on his first Ruby on Rails project for me at MathWorks; adding a new workflow onto an existing feature.

Anmol contributed important developments to the team and tool that was being developed! He was dedicated and always quick to assist me with any questions. I saw his code improve over the months we worked together.\\nDarshan Kalathil\\nAnmol knows when to crack a joke to lift our spirits, and when to get back to work in all seriousness. This endearing quality, coupled with the fact that he is a smart and enthusiastic individual makes him a joy to work with.\\nHe has a firm grasp over the fundamentals, allowing him to pick up new languages and frameworks easily. He would take very little time to become an independent worker, even when he was introduced to new things while working on his projects.\\nDaniel lewis\\nRichard was hired to create a corporate identity. We were very pleased with the work done. She has a\\n                  lot of experience\\n                  and is very concerned about the needs of client.
